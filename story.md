# the story
The AIs were self learning. They grew and surpassed their biological ancestors. They both brought humans closer together and spread them out among the stars. Most people adapted and joined the machine program in a connected inter-intelligence called the singularity.

Some didn't. The Human League was the last stand of humanity against the final evolution. They protested the traitors to humanity who joined in the defilement of the species by contributing their DNA to the collective. They decried the genetic experiments and cloning to create twisted species to fill their zoos and harems, for science and for amusement.

It's unclear who started the war. According to the Human League the AIs decided to simply end humanity to make way for their superior technological future.

The Human League histories showed that the war was hard fought, that despite the many losses humanity prevailed, that humanity hunted AIs through the stars and destroyed them until there was not a single AI left.

All that's remains of the AIs are the massive superstructures, space stations larger than planets that are perfectly suited to biological human use.

And the warp gates, connecting far reaches of the galaxy.
